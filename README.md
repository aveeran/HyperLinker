# A Chromium Browser Extension for the Wikipedia Game

I am excited to announce that **HyperLinker**, my Chromium-based browser extension designed for the "Wikipedia Game," is undergoing a significant upgrade. To enhance maintainability, scalability, and developer experience, I am transitioning from **JavaScript** to **TypeScript**. This migration ensures robust type-checking, better code organization, and a smoother development process.

While I work on this upgrade, some functionality might be temporarily paused. My target is to complete the migration and resume full functionality by **December 1, 2024**.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several advantages that align with my project goals:

- **Type Safety**: Helps catch errors during development, reducing runtime issues.
- **Improved Readability**: Clearer code documentation with explicit type definitions.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Makes the codebase easier to manage and extend.
- **Better Tooling**: Superior IDE support, including autocompletion, refactoring tools, and linting.

## Temporary Limitations

While the migration is underway, the following might occur:

- Certain features may be unavailable or partially functional.
- Development updates may be slower as I focus on the transition.

I appreciate your patience and understanding during this period.

## Progress and Updates

To track my progress, refer to the project’s [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/aveeran/HyperLinker/issues) page. I'll share regular updates about milestones and potential delays.

Thank you for your support as I work to make HyperLinker better than ever!
